*The ferry is part of the collective memory of the inhabitants of Lochau. A place of everyday life and special occurences. The formed qualities hereof should be carried forward. Spatial configurations, circulation patterns, visual axis, materiality, colors, proportions and a choice of existing elements will be constituent for the Neue Fähre.* <br>
*The main level is raised of the ground, as the deck of a ferry would be, and the access points are set where they already were. Both decks at the bow and stern comprise together with the upper deck, the public areas to be accessible at all time. These areas by themselves or in interaction with the restaurant, the workshop, and the square in front of the ferry, enable a manifold of possible uses.*

left: softening the railway border<br>
*Today, the underpass connects a green park and an asphalted car park. These
two elements do not stand in relation to each other. Therefore, we propose an approximation of both by partially unsealing the surface of the parking fields and marking paths with lattice stones or simply gravel. The pedestrian and bicycle paths will be lined with trees, as on the shore side, softening the caesura of the tracks. Wildflower meadows on both ends of the underpass would mediate between the now stark existing contrast.*<br>
right: towards a regenerative agriculture<br>
*Current agriculture land shouldn’t be kept as monoculture grassland. These “green deserts” in the center of Lochau offer barely any biodiversity and give the habitants no space for engagement or interaction. A process of transition towards a regenerative agriculture would offer space for multiple uses and actors.*

*Benjamin and Lacis evocative narrative can be read as the city's resistance to the fixed, reinforcing latent potentials of improvisation and coexistence. The city is depicted as a dynamic myriad of simultaneously animated playing stages. Whether this all encompassing term porosity is capable of this or not, it offers a point of departure and a lens to observe the city.*<br>
rigth: Football being played inside the Galleria Umberto I in Naples, July 2019 <br>
*As the kids playing football inside the Galleria Umberto I after the commerce finishes its daily business, urban space is articulated anew, inscribing a practice that loosens the programmed correspondence between function and place. This unexpected scene in July 2019, is the cause for this proposal, an event in Neapolitan life – a football tournament in the Galleria Umberto I.*

*The proposal consists of a net hanging of the roof structure, protecting the facade and spectators, while encapsulating the atmosphere for the players on the field.<br> The playing field is at the crossing axis of the Galleria, exactly aligned with the North- South (Cardo) and East-West (Decumanus) axis in an otherwise mostly curvilinear urban fabric. The geometry offers dimensions for a game of 7 vs. 7. The playing fields outlines are marked with simple black tape at the edges of the patterned pavement. 4 goals are set up. Each team therefore attacks two goals and defends two goals along their respective axis.*
